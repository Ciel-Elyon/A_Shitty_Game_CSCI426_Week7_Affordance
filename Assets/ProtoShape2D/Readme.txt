Online manual: http://ax23w4.com/devlog/protoshape2d

To create new ProtoShape 2D object in your scene, click on GameObject 
menu in Unity window, then go to 2D Object and then click ProtoShape2D.
That's it, now you have a shape in the scene which you can edit.

To add new points to the shape, just click on the marker that appears
on the edges of selected shape as next to your mouse cursor.

To remove points hold down CTRL button and click on the points you
want to remove.

You can drag points around. When dragging a point hold SHIFT button 
to snap the point horizontally and vertically to other points.

When you click on the point it becomes selected and its property editor
appears in the bottom right corner of the scene view. There you can set
precise position and curvature of the point.

In object's inpector you can set properties of the object, like fill,
level of details for curves, automatic collider and more.
